*This is a template that will be used to document different features of the application.*

*Upon discussion, we can choose to either have a new tab for each feature, or have a much larger page where all features are documented, and use a heading - subheading hierarchy in order to split them up (like this page). For now, this will be a placeholder example of a documentation file.*

*This is just a template, so we do not need to follow it. I added in everything I thought would be necessary, but we can always choose to add/cut stuff out.*
